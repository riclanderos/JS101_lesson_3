// Question 1. Will the following functions return the same results?
function first() {
  return {
    prop1: "hi there"
  };
}

function second() {

/* They will return different values. The first function will return the string. The second function will return undefined because javascript will place a semicolon after the return, ending the function there. */

// Question 2. What does the last line in the following code output?
let object = { first: [1] };
let numArray = object["first"];
numArray.push(2);

console.log(numArray); //  => "[1, 2]"
console.log(object);  //=> { first: [1, 2] }

// A)

/* Question 4. Ben was tasked to write a simple JavaScript function to determine whether an input string is an IP address using 4 
dot-separated numbers, e.g., 10.4.5.11. He is not familiar with regular expressions.
Alyssa supplied Ben with a function named isAnIpNumber. It determines whether a string is a numeric string between 0 and 255 as 
required for IP numbers and asked Ben to use it. Here's the code that Ben wrote: */
function isDotSeparatedIpAddress(inputString) {
  let dotSeparatedWords = inputString.split(".");
  while (dotSeparatedWords.length > 0) {
    let word = dotSeparatedWords.pop();
    if (!isAnIpNumber(word)) {
      break;
    }
  }

  return true;
}
/* Alyssa reviewed Ben's code and said, "It's a good start, but you missed a few things. You're not returning a false condition, and 
you're not handling the case when the input string has more or less than 4 components, e.g., 4.5.5 or 1.2.3.4.5: both those values 
should be invalid."
Help Ben fix his code. */
